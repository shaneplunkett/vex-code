# Message composer

Messages can contain up to 120,000 characters. If a draft is longer, T3 Code keeps it in the
composer and shows how many characters need to be removed. Shorten the draft or split it into
multiple messages, then send again in the same thread.

You can attach images up to 10 MB. On servers that support file uploads, web and desktop can also
attach text files, PDFs, ZIP archives, and other files. Each file can be up to the limit advertised
by the server, capped at 50 MB. Each message can contain up to eight attachments in total. Files
upload directly to the environment, where your agent can read, copy, or edit them by their file path.

On web and desktop, attachments upload as soon as you add them. The send button becomes available
after every upload finishes. Failed uploads can be retried or removed. On mobile, attachments are
currently limited to images.

If you reload before a file finishes uploading, the draft keeps the file's name and shows **Attach
again** next to it. Attach the file again or remove it, then send.

On web and desktop, HEIC and HEIF photos are automatically converted to JPEG when you drag them into
the composer or paste them into a message.

On mobile, the model picker shows each OpenCode model's upstream provider, such as Anthropic,
GitHub Copilot, or OpenCode Zen, beneath its name. Search by that provider name to narrow the list
when starting a thread or changing an existing thread's model.

## Prompt stash

Use the default shortcut, `Cmd+S` on macOS or `Ctrl+S` on Windows and Linux, to stash the current
prompt and its attachments after all file uploads finish. Restore the entry later from the stash
menu. Stashes that contain files must be restored in the environment where those files were
uploaded. Stashed files stay uploaded on the server for 24 hours. If you restore an entry after
that, the file comes back with **Attach again** next to it. Attach the file again or remove it, then
send.

## Commands and skills

Type `/` to open the command menu. Type `$` to find and add a skill. Skill rows show their source,
such as System, Personal, Project, or App.

On mobile, these menus are available on the **New task** screen before you start a thread. They use
the skills and commands from the selected environment and provider.

A selected `$name` chip is an explicit skill invocation, not a textual hint. T3 Code keeps the
canonical `$name` in the timeline and translates it to the provider's native invocation when the
turn starts. If a provider cannot preserve the selected invocation, the turn fails with a visible
error instead of sending `$name` as inert prose.

The `/` menu is command-only. If a provider also reports one of its skills as a native slash command,
T3 Code hides that entry so explicit skill invocation stays under the canonical `$` picker.

Claude currently supports one explicit skill per message and cannot combine that invocation with an
image attachment. T3 Code rejects those combinations clearly; send multiple skills in separate turns,
or invoke the skill first and attach images in a follow-up. Skills marked
`disable-model-invocation: true` are still available to the `$` picker because the user is explicitly
invoking them. Skills switched off through Claude's `skillOverrides`, or marked
`user-invocable: false`, stay hidden.

On desktop, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter` on Windows and Linux from a new thread to
start it in the background. T3 Code opens another new thread and shows an **Open** action for the
thread that started. The new thread keeps the selected workspace mode and base branch. If **New
worktree** is selected, each background thread creates its own worktree.
